# Image-Encryption-using-Genetic-Algorithm
This repository implements image encryption using a genetic algorithm (GA), applying techniques like crossover, mutation, and tournament selection. It also includes image analysis methods (entropy, correlation, NPCR) to evaluate encryption strength. The project demonstrates GA's effectiveness in image security.
